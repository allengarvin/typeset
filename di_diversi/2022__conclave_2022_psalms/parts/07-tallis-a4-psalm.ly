% O come in one to praise the Lord,
%  and him recount our stay and wealth,
%  all hearty joys let us record,
%  to this strong rock, our Lord of health.
% 
% His face, with praise let us prevent,
%  his facts in sight let us denounce;
%  join we I say, in glad assent,
%  our psalms and hymns let us pronounce.
% 
% For why? this Lord is God of might,
%  for help at need, whom we may call;
%  a puissant King in his bright light,
%  he pass'th all gods by ruling all.
% 
% All coasts of Earth by him do lie,
%  his cells and grounds though they be deep;
%  as fast by him stand mountains high,
%  and stoop to him, though they be steep,
% 
% The Sea is his, his work of hands,
%  her rise and fall, with all her road;
%  the land from her by power stands,
%  whom God so stay'd for his abode.
% 
% O then come we, let us adore,
%  and prostrate lie on both our knees;
%  he made us all, both rich and poor,
%  both king and slave, in their degrees.
% 
% For God he is, our Lord and stay,
%   his people we, in pasture near,
%   his flock of hand, who leadâ€™th our way;
%   his voice to day, if well ye hear,
% 
% Beware, say I, ye hard no hearts
%  against his grace, to you so meant,
%  as desert saw once strife overwhart,
%  like tempting day of mad intent.
% 
% In which pastime, your fathers old
%  did tempt my strength, to prove my might;
%  they proved but me in scorn too bold,
%  where yet my works they saw in sight.
% 
% Full forty years, I blamed this age,
%  great griefs by them I felt by this;
%  I said even thus, to spy their rage:
%  They err in heart, my ways they miss.
%  
% To whom I sware all wrathfully,
%  by their foul strays thus forced thereto:
%  if they so evil my rest should see,
%  then blame have I if it be so.

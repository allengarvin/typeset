%  1. O come in one to praise the Lord,
%     and him recount our stay and wealth,
%     all hearty joys let us record,
%     to this strong rock, our Lord of health.
%  2.  His face, with praise let us prevent,
%     his facts in sight let us denounce;
%     join we I say, in glad assent,
%     our psalms and hymns let us pronounce.

%  3.  For why? this Lord is God of might,
%     for help at need, whom we may call;
%     a puissant King in his bright light,
%     he pass'th all gods by ruling all.
%  4.  All coasts of Earth by him do lie,
%  his cells and grounds though they be deep;
%  as fast by him stand mountains high,
%  and stoop to him, though they be steep,

%  5.  The Sea is his, his work of hands,
%  her rise and fall, with all her road;
%  the land from her by power stands,
%  whom God so stay'd for his abode.
%  6.  O then come we, let us adore,
%  and prostrate lie on both our knees;
%  he made us all, both rich and poor,
%  both king and slave, in their degrees.

%  7.  For God he is, our Lord and stay,
%  his people we, in pasture near,
%  his flock of hand, who leadâ€™th our way;
%  his voice to day, if well ye hear,
%  8.  Beware, say I, ye hard no hearts
%  against his grace, to you so meant,
%  as desert saw once strife overwhart,
%  like tempting day of mad intent.

%  9.  In which pastime, your fathers old
%  did tempt my strength, to prove my might;
%  they proved but me in scorn too bold,
%  where yet my works they saw in sight.

% 10.  Full forty years, I blamed this age,
%  great griefs by them I felt by this;
%  I said even thus, to spy their rage:
%  They err in heart, my ways they miss.
% 
% 11.  To whom I sware all wrathfully,
%  by their foul strays thus forced thereto:
%  if they so evil my rest should see,
%  then blame have I if it be so.

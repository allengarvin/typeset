The trio sonata form, typically with two high instruments like two violins,
and a bass (usually with an implied or explicit continuo) arose around the
year 1600, and grew in popularity throughout the 17th century. Here, we
include simple dance music, that would eventually be put into suites and
would become the <i>sonata da camera</i>, as well as the more abstract
<i>sonata da chiesa</i>, which initially grew out of the equal-part
polyphonic canzona or ricercar style. Many but not all of the pieces I've
set are in <i>lo stile moderno</i>.

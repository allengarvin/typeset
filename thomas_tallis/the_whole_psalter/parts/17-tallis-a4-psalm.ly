%  Come Holy Ghost, eternal God,
%  which dost from God proceed:
%  the Father first, and eke the Son,
%  One God, as we do read.
% 
%  Oh visit thou our minds and hearts,
%  thy heavenly grace inspire,
%  that we in truth and godliness
%  may set our whole desire.
% 
%  Thou art O Spir't, the Comforter
%  in woe and hard distress,
%  the heavenly gift of God so high,
%  which tongue cannot express.
% 
%  Thou fountain art, and lively spring
%  of joy celestial,
%  the fire so bright, the love so clear,
%  and unction spiritual.
% 
%  For thou in gifts art manifold,
%  whereby Christ's Church doth stand;
%  and writest thy love in faithful hearts,
%  the power of God, his hand.
% 
%  And like as thou hast promise made,
%  thou givest the speech of grace,
%  that through thy help the praise of God
%  may sound in every place.
% 
%  O Holy Ghost, to move our wits,
%  send down thine heavenly Light;
%  inflame our hearts, our God to serve
%  with love, both day and night.
% 
%  Our weakness, strength confirm us Lord,
%  both feeble, faint, and frail,
%  that neither Flesh, the World, nor Devil
%  in us do once prevail.
% 
%  Put back from us our enemies,
%  and grant that we obtain
%  sweet peace of heart with God and man,
%  from grudge and proud disdain.
% 
%  And grant, O Lord, O Leader sure,
%  that we by thee as guide
%  may safe eschew the snares of sin,
%  from thee no time to slide.
% 
%  And plenty, Lord, of thy good grace,
%  grant us, we humble pray;
%  be thou our joy and Comforter,
%  to scape that dreadful day.
% 
%  Of strife and foul dissension,
%  O Lord, dissolve the bands,
%  and knit the knot of peace and love
%  throughout all Christian lands.
% 
%  Grant us, O Lord, through thee to know
%  the Father, most of Might,
%  that we of his belov√®d Son
%  may sure obtain the sight.
% 
%  And that with perfect, stable faith
%  we might acknowledge thee,
%  the Spir't of them of both, I say,
%  One God, and Persons three.
% 
%  Be laud to God the Father high,
%  and God his Son, praise ye;
%  be praise to God the Holy Spir't,
%  One God in Trinity.
% 
%  Pray we that Christ the Savior 
%  vouchsafe his Spir't to send
%  to all which true profess his Name,
%  till all the world doth end.

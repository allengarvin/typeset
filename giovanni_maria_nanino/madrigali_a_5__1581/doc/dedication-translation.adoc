= TO THE MOST MAGNFICENT AND REVERED

== Signor Lelio Pasqualino

=== Our most observant lord

Although the affection that we have for Your Excellency is already well
known and does not require any further evidence, we still felt that we
were lacking in our duty by not giving any new signs of it. Thus,
whereas we are publishing some of our Madrigals, we deemed it appropriate
to dedicate them to Your Excellency, confident in your kindness and
believing that they will be as pleasing to you as they are dear to us,
especially as we present them to you, whose courtesy and humanity we have
always experienced, especially in your home, a haven for the virtuous,
for which we are deeply affectionate and grateful; and we beg you to consider us
as such, for we kiss your hand. From Rome, 10 January 1581.

From Your Excellency's

Affectionate Servants

Giovanni Maria Nanino & Annibale Stabile.

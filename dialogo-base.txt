The dialogo madrigal appeared very early during the years of popularity of the madrigal in Italy,
with Verdelot composing the first. It provided an opportunity to express musically the idea
of intercourse between two speakers or ideas presented in the poetry (see for example
"Quando nascesti Amore?" below, a sonnet written by Panfilo, between an unspecified interlocutor
and the concept of love itself). Past the middle of the 16th century, Adriano Willaert and 
Orlando di Lasso are especially associated with it--not by coincidence they are also associated
with the <a href="cat-polychoral.html">polychoral motet</a>. During the height of the popularity
of the madrigal, composers often set a dialog madrigal at the end of madrigal prints as a
capstone for the collection. See especially the large collection of more than 30 examples,

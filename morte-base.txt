It has a French name, <i>La petite mort,</i> but it is nearly ubiquitous
in Italian secular poetry of the 15-17th centuries, especially when nymphs
and shepherds interact. Of course, not every madrigal that references death
or dying is actually a sexual metaphor: Gibbon's "The Silver Swan" certainly
isn't, for instance, while Arcadelt's "Dolce e bianco cigno" clearly is, an oddity
when you consider how often they're paired in modern concerts. And many Italian texts use death 
as a metaphor for loss or as a literal fact. Here I am highlighting the more
obvious examples.

[This list is far from complete: I added this Jan 2023, and it will take me a
while to go through every madrigal referencing death]

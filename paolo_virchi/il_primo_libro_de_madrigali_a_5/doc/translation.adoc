If all things, Most Serene Prince, desire to unite, as much as they can
to their cause, it is reasonable that I dedicate these Madrigals to Your
Highness as the one who was the main reason, both for having gathered me
in your Court where there are famous and illustrious men in this science
and others, and for having favored me in having most of them sung, and
graciously hearing them; therefore, I have taken the daring to put them
in the light. It is indeed true that I attribute as much to the sweetness
of the voice of those illustrious ladies who sang them, as to my own
artistry, which with their wonderful disposition and the new, never heard
before way of passing and accents, greatly enhance the delight of this
music more easily than I can the fame of their excellence. And because I
do not know how to express my infinite gratitude with other signs to Your
Highness for the favors I receive from her, I ask that she accept this
small token of my servitude with the kindness and greatness of spirit
that she usually demonstrates in her other actions. With this, I desire
every happiness for Your Highness. In Ferrara, on September 15, 1584.

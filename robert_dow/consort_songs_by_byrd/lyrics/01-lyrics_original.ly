        \line { such perfect joy therin I find, }
        \line { That it excells all other blisse, }
        \line { which God or Nature hath assign'd  }
        \line { Though much I want, that most would have, }
        \line { yet still my mind forbids to crave. }

        \line { 2. No princely port nor welthie store, }
        \line { no force to winne a victorie, }
        \line { no wyly wit to salve a sore, }
        \line { no shape to winne a loving eye: }
        \line { to none of these I yeld as thrall, }
        \line { for why my minde despise them all. }

        \line { 3. I see that plentie surfeits oft, }
        \line { and hastie clymbers soonest fall: }
        \line { I see that such as are a loft, }
        \line { mishap doth threaten most of all: }
        \line { these get with toyle and keepe with feare, }
        \line { such cares my minde can never beare. }

        \line { look what I want my minde supplies, }
        \line { loe thus I triumph like a King, }
        \line { my minde content with any thing. }

        \line { 5. I laugh not at anothers losse, }
        \line { nor grudge not at anothers gaine: }
        \line { no worldly waves my minde can tosse, }
        \line { I brooke that is anothers bane: }
        \line { I feare no foe nor nor fawne on friend, }
        \line { I loth not lyfe nor dread mine end. }

        \line { 6. My wealth is health and perfecte ease, }
        \line { and conscience cleere my chiefe defence, }
        \line { I never seeke by brybes to please, }
        \line { nor by desert to give offence: }
        \line { thus doe I live, thus will I dye, }
        \line { would all did so as well as I. }

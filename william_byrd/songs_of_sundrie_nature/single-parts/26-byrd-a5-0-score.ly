            Note: The word "Rich" in the final couplet of the sonnet
            is capitalized in all the parts, and almost certainly
            refers to Penelope Rich, n√©e Devereux (sister of Robert Devereux, 
            Earl of Essex), beloved muse of Sir Philip Sidney (who,
            it is thought, was the inspiration for Stella in his work   
            \italic { Astrophel and Stella.) }
        }

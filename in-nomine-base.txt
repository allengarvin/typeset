The <i>in nomine</i> is a genre of polyphonic composition unique to English consort music, originating
in the Benedictus section of John Taverner's <i>Gloria tibi Trinitas</i> mass (written circa 1530). The
composer uses the "In nomine Domine" plainchaint as a cantus firmus around which to weave counterpoint.
Around the late 1560s or 1570s, multiple composers began to write such pieces, and the popularity
persisted about a century, with the last period example composed by a youthful Henry Purcell. It is
most associated with the viol consort, though a few keyboard, vocal, and lute in nomines are known.
Typically, a high voice viol plays the in nomine plainchant in single breves, usually but not always
entering before any other instruments. <p>
Most of my transcriptions are Elizabethan examples. Later Jacobean in nomine compositions tended to
be very complex and difficult pieces that show off the counterpoint skills of the composer.<p>
